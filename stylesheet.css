/* 
For the layout I need to create something that looks like a calculator.
-- So the first thing we'll want to do is layout our sections with flexbox as a column.

This will be made up of a header section and a body section, the body section will hold
our calculator, whilst our header will have transforrmative typed text that welcomes the
user and invites them to utilize our calculator.

We'll colorise the sections so that we can map out the overall look.

-- Then we'll make our container for the calculator.
Inside the calculator container, we'll have to make a display-container for the LED screen
and a buttons-container which will have as many buttons as we decide to go with, dependant
on the type of calculator we make.

After this we know we'll need
 + (Plus)
 - (Minus)
 * (Multiplication)
 / (Division)
